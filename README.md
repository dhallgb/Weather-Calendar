# Weather calendar

A simple calendar pulled from Google, using weather and forecast icons to display on an eink display from Waveshare. It uses the library dhallgb/eInk. It will work on Micropython, and should work on other CPython implementations.

To use, create the file __config.json__ from the template __config.json.template__ and replace the example values.
