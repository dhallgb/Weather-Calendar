# Weather calendar

A simple calendar pulled from Google, using weather and forecast icons to display on an Waveshare epaper 4.3" display. It will work on Micropython, and may work on CPython implementations if you use another library. This uses the eInk library from https://github.com/dhallgb/eInk-micropython

To use, create the file __config.json__ from the template __config.json.template__ and replace the example values for the Open Weather Map (http://openweathermap.org) and Google Calendar, both of which need API keys. 

Icons are taken from The Noun Project (https://thenounproject.com/), and I have used the weather icons from artist 'Per'.
